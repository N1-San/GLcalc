# The Good Looking Calculator
## Who needs a calculator that you can't even customize the look off.

GLcalc or The Good Looking Calculator is nothing flashy, it's just a simple basic arithematic calculator.

> Fun Fact - I got the idea to make this at 5am when i was trying to sleep after spending the whole night playing warframe and watching anime(Daily Lifes of Highschool Boys).

==WHY==
because why not. I agree that there are a lot of basic arithematic calculators out there, basically every mobile phone manufacuter have their own, but personally i don't like how any of those look, so this is what i would like my calculator to look like. The star feature being the ability and freedom for the user to customize the look of the calculator.
